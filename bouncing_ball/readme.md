This Bouncing Ball program was built through Vivado VHDL on the XILINX Digilent A7-100T FPGA board. The project uses five VHDL source files (clk_wiz_0.vhd, clk_wiz_0_clk_wiz.vhd, vga_sync.vhd, ball.vhd, and vga_top.vhd) and one Vivado constraint file (vga_top.xdc) to generate a game of pong on a 800x600 Video Graphics Array (VGA) monitor.

Once synthesizing, implementing and programming the FPGA with the baseline program, a red, square pong ball of size 8 will be shown through the VGA output monitor, bouncing back and forth on a single vertical axis.
